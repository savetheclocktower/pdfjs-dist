**NOTE:** This is Mozilla’s own Apache-licensed code. It exists here because I needed a place from which `npm` could install this package without its optional dependencies — particularly the `canvas` package and its native module. It will not necessarily be kept up to date.

If you found this via a web search: don’t install this. You don’t know me, and you shouldn’t trust me. Don’t even install this from Mozilla’s own GitHub repo for `pdfjs-dist`; it hasn’t been updated in a couple years. [Install this directly from `npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfjs-dist) instead.

# PDF.js

PDF.js is a Portable Document Format (PDF) library that is built with HTML5.
Our goal is to create a general-purpose, web standards-based platform for
parsing and rendering PDFs.

This is a pre-built version of the PDF.js source code. It is automatically
generated by the build scripts.

For usage with older browsers/environments, without native support for the
latest JavaScript features, please see the `legacy/` folder.
Please see [this wiki page](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#faq-support) for information about supported browsers/environments.

See https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js for learning and contributing.
